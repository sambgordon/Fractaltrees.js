# Recursive-Fractal-Trees

A fractal generating app using native Javascript and an instance of Canvas.

Branches are generated that get smaller and smaller infinitely  (i.e. 0 is an asymptote that the width of the branches will approach - leave it running for a while and see!).

## NOTE: Runs best in Chrome!

*UPDATE: I now intend on integrating a UI with the app using jQuery where the user is able to adjust certain parameters themselves. Stay tuned.

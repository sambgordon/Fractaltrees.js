# Recursive-Fractal-Trees

A fractal generating app using native Javascript and an instance of Canvas.

Branches are generated that get smaller and smaller infinitely  (i.e. 0 is an asymptote that the width of the branches will approach - leave it running for a while and see!).

## NOTE: Runs best in Chrome!

*UPDATE: I now intend on integrating a UI with the app using jQuery where the user is able to adjust certain parameters themselves. Stay tuned.

mainBranch = the main generated branch
subBranches = the sub branches that are generated "infinitely"
travel = defines travel distance of branches
branchWidth = Width of the stroke generated branches - keep in mind they
get exponentially thinner and thinner as recursion continues
startX, StartY, endX, endY = Defines path starting and ending values
length = length of each new tree relative to window size
angle = angle of path of each new tree

| Var             | Description     |
| -------------   |:---------------:|
| mainBranch      | the main generated branch |
| subBranches     | centered      |
| travel          | are neat      |
| branchWidth     | are neat      |
| length          | are neat      |
| angle           | are neat      |
